## About

The challenge was to create a blog app from scratch using Prismic CMS (with NextJS) from a Figma layout:
* Create all styles based on the layout
* Create 2 pages, index (for posts summary) and post (to display full post content)
* Get content from Prismic using SSG (static site generator) feature in NextJS
* Load more posts if available using fetch API
* Calculate estimated time reading post

*Tools:*
* NextJS
* Prismic CMS
* fetch API

## Installation
0. Install Prismic and get Prismic Repo and set as env variable
1. Install it by running `yarn` in the project's root directory
2. Run the project with `yarn start`
3. Build the project with `yarn build`

## Notes
* As an exercise, this project wasn’t focused on advanced optimizations regarding data storage, processing, accessibility, scalability, cross-browser compatibility, etc. There’s still a lot to be done about it.
* As most projects, this one is not bug/error-free. If you find any bug or unexpected behavior, feel free to get in touch, here is my email - raphael.lima.coelho@gmail.com
